First reqs and software installation
Downloading necessary source from suckless or onw repo
Creating bin folder for binaries
Compiling, or creating an own repo with the already built binaries (with necessary patches)
After that ricing Vim, Tmux, dir-listing, GTK-3, GTK-2, fonts, QT.. ________
Setting up bashrc, compton, ranger, xinitrc, Xresources, Xdefaults  ________|-----> for these stuff a dot file repo should be created
maybe setting up Firefox theme (maybe cant be automatized)
fancygit bash
Lightdm should be used as DM. But for now I just decided to to use any DM.
Screen lock also necessary. Slock will be used. Key combination should be added to dwm to lock it and should check for themes.

Important Note: Keep all stuff in user home folder where possible (I wont keep the binaries there, I rather install it on the system.)


TODO
Custom repos that I should create: st, dwm, dmenu, dwmblocks, dotfiles
Repo for slock. 
Put Lock symbol on slcok.
I should add the binaries of compiled file to .gitingore.
Patch dwm to autoright and maybe autorun - Assignrightandbelow patched, autorun is not necessary yet.
-dmenu center
vim autocempletion (file and development too, supertab)
Suckless tool should be located under .config (ex. .config/Suckless/dmenu)
Slock: the monitor should be sent to sleep after a certain amount of time.

Video and sound card drivers should be installed properly.
For sound it seems alsa will be enough for my usage, pulseaudio is not necessary.
I will not need network manager tray either.
If certain settings will be necessary for sound or network, then alsamixer and nmtui should be used for easier setup.
Xbacklight will be necesseray for backlight control and for backlight and sound settings change a key combination should be added to dwm config.
